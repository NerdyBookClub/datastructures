Learn Data Structures
=====================

(a.k.a. "Fake Computer Science 112")

Data structures are a fundamental topic in computer science; in fact, some have said that the field is simply the study of data structures and algorithms. This repository and the code and words contained within aims to provide a basic introduction to some common data structures.

Wat Do?
-------

This repository contains a number of assignments, which may be completed in the programming language of your choice. Each assignment will include test code in as many programming languages as I can bother to write, which you may use to write your own implementations.

Before you begin working on learning data structures, it's important that you have a reasonable understanding of the programming language or languages you plan on using. You'll need to be familiar with at least the basic syntax and how to compile and run programs in your language. Examples and tests for the topics discussed in this course will be provided in as many languages as possible. I plan on supporting C, Java, and sometimes Python primarily, with other languages added when I'm less lazy.

If you're interested in learning the basics of C, I'm working on an introductory course in C, as well. Once it's a little bit more finished, that should give you the basic knowledge necessary to complete the assignments in this course in C. You can find that [here](https://github.com/NerdyBookClub/intro-to-c).

If you'd like to get my advice or feedback on your attempts to complete any of the assignments given here, try [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository and committing your code to your fork. Put the code for each assignment in that assignment's directory. This way, I can see what you've written, leave comments and advice, and so on. Don't feel like you have to do this; it's not like I'm grading you or anything.
